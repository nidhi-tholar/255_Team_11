### DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM:
The project aims to predict the winning percentage in a game of chess using data mining techniques. A chess games is played by two people having black and white pieces, the person with white pieces making the first move. The main goal of the project is whenever a player chooses for any particular opening we to predict the outcome of game using the enormous amount data collected over the years. Along with that we will have sub-goals to find out which opening was famous at a given time(pre/post engine era), variation(time format), etc.

### Considered Data:
Most of the data considered in this project will be taken from the databases which stores chess games played over the years and also, we will try to create our own data by playing games manually. 

### Methodology and Approach:
Preliminary process includes determining the moves and results in the dataset and determining if the dataset is clean. Further, the usage of Identifying Frequent Openings, Naïve Bayes Classification to determine pattern of win-lose-draw in the played games dataset. From the determined games, A decision tree could be incorporated to make the computer’s move to result the outcome of the round. Though the considered methodology on determining and mining might change in actual implementation, the initial phase of exploration suggests the considered methods as a possibility.

### Success Determination:
The success ratio will be calculated if the algorithm predicts correctly the outcomes of the game played using any certain opening and whether it holds true for the actual result of the game.
